### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



My name is Claire Mevolhon and I am a developper in Artificial Intelligence.  
I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition, that include computer vision, robotics and AI.  

I really like AI: different algorithms with "simple" concepts and an amazing output!  

I also really like computer vision. I was lucky to work on a facial recognition, and I worked with DLib, OpenCV and some CNN.


However, I worked on several project without AI, for example I implemented some codes for SEVRI.
